    // cache hit rather than a fresh round trip. FeedFragment owns the trigger (scroll-settle + debounce and
    // which rows are visible); this half owns the gates, the extension lookup and the cap.
    //
    // PLAYLISTS ONLY. Every playlist loadTracks implementation read - Deezer, Offline, Unified, plus
    // Spotify and Tidal - uses only the id and routing extras, all set when the item is parsed into a
    // shelf. Albums are excluded because that is where both known failure shapes live: Tidal's album
    // loadTracks does album.extras["json"]!! on a field written by loadAlbum, so an unloaded item throws;
    // Spotify's passes the album object into toTrack, so an unloaded item silently degrades every track's
    // metadata. Albums get their speed from the durable cache and the Deezer results() handoff instead.
    //
    // NOT WHILE PLAYING is doing real work, not defensive boilerplate: the 2026-05-27 per-track
    // api.track() lookup was reverted because a speculative network call competing with playback caused
    // battery drain and cellular playback problems. This is the same shape, so it carries the same guard.
    // UNMETERED covers the cellular half.
    //
    // PROCESS-WIDE CAP, not per feed or per tab: a per-tab reset would let a user defeat it by cycling
    // tabs. The durable cache means an item is warmed at most once per TTL, so the cap is rarely
    // approached. When it is, prefetch silently stops and the user gets exactly today's behaviour - a
    // degradation to the status quo rather than a failure, which is the right trade for something
    // speculative, but silent, so it is written down here rather than left to be discovered in a profiler.

     * Persist (or remove) the CURRENT [feedSortState] under the key it was loaded for.
     *
     * ⚠️ CALL THIS FROM USER ACTIONS ONLY. Saving a sort is something a person asks for; it is not a
     * property of having rendered the feed. Until 2026-09-06 the write lived inside getFeedSourceData and
     * fired on EVERY pass through the sort branch, pairing `selectedTabFlow.value` (already advanced by a
     * tab switch) with `feedSortState.value` (not yet re-read for the new tab, because that read lives in
     * a SEPARATE collector — see dataFlow). A saved sort on one tab was therefore written to a different
     * tab's key, silently and permanently.
     *
     * WHY THAT MATTERED MORE THAN IT LOOKS. The gate it arms is not cosmetic: getFeedSourceData's sort
     * branch runs data.loadTill(shelfLimit = 2000, itemLimit = MAX_SORT_SEARCH_ITEMS) BEFORE the flatMap,
     * materialising up to 2000 raw Shelf objects each still holding its full track list. That is the shape
     * that OOM'd on Combine's feed; MAX_SORT_SEARCH_ITEMS exists as a CAP added in response (015428a5,
     * 2026-07-19), sized on the assumption that the branch is user-requested. A spurious write breaks that
     * assumption — it arms an eager load on a feed nobody chose to sort.
     *
     * ⚠️ WHO WAS AFFECTED: everyone who has ever applied a saved sort on ANY tab of a MULTI-TAB feed.
     * Library and Home both qualify. The damaged tab is not the sorted one — it is whichever tab the user
     * switched TO while the previous tab's state was still loaded, and because the entry is on disk it
     * survived restarts. It went unnoticed on flat tabs (Library's Playlists/Albums/Tracks/Artists), where
     * every shelf is already a Shelf.Item and the flatMap is a no-op; it is glaring on a tab of carousels.
     *
     * ⚠️ save == false MEANS DELETE, NOT SKIP. Applying with the checkbox unticked, or resetting from the
     * sheet's toolbar, must REMOVE any existing entry. Skipping the write instead (what the old code did)
     * left the previous entry on disk to be restored on the next feed load — which is why the reset action
     * appeared to work and then silently un-did itself.
     *
     * The delete is a direct File.delete() HERE rather than a CacheUtils API, matching
     * Cached.bustTracksCache: CacheUtils states a deliberate no-delete policy in getFromCache's comment,
     * and this keeps that intact. Deliberately NOT saveToCache(key, null) — that writes the JSON literal
     * `null`, which getFromCache then fails to decode into a non-nullable State and logs as
     * "getFromCache unreadable: folder=sort" on EVERY feed load, forever.
