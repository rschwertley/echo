    /**
     * Full gateway records for a list of track ids, chunked. Response is `results.data[]` per call, the
     * SAME shape playlist.getSongs returns, so DeezerParser.toTrack consumes it unchanged.
     *
     * ⚠️ PARAMETER IS `SNG_IDS`, UPPERCASE, AND THE PROJECT RECORD CONTRADICTS ITSELF ON THIS.
     * One summary records the open-source verification as lowercase `{"sng_ids":[...]}`; a later one
     * records the shipped call as uppercase SNG_IDS. NEITHER could be checked against this tree, because
     * NO song.getListData CALL EXISTED HERE AT ALL before 2026-09-07 — the "shipped re-resolve" both
     * summaries describe is not in the code. Settled by reading the source again (deezer-py, gw.py):
     *     def get_tracks(self, sng_ids):
     *         body = self.api_call('song.getListData', {'SNG_IDS': sng_ids})
     * UPPERCASE, ids passed as a list, response read at data[] under results. Use that.
     *
     * ⚠️ AND DO NOT LEAN ON "gw-light PARAMS ARE CASE-INSENSITIVE" — NOBODY VERIFIED IT. This file is
     * itself mixed (deezer.pageTrack takes lowercase `sng_id`; favorite_song.add/remove take uppercase
     * `SNG_ID`) and both work — but that is equally consistent with each METHOD having its own fixed
     * casing, which is the likelier reading. Match the verified casing per method; do not generalise.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE CHUNK SIZE IS STILL UNVERIFIED — BUT IT IS NOT ARBITRARY. "Safe batch limit to be
     * verified" was left open by an earlier session and is still open: deezer-py sends the WHOLE list in
     * one call with no slicing, so there is no known upper bound and no evidence one exists. Nothing here
     * probed the ceiling either, and this chunking is a NO-OP for the case it was built for (a
     * smarttracklist is ~40 tracks — one call), so the multi-chunk path ships untested in anger. If a large
     * list ever fails, this number is the first suspect and the answer is a capture, not a guess.
     * WHAT IT DOES HAVE IS FIELD HISTORY: chunked(100) SHIPPED in d221f4c2 and ran until 04c67817. This is
     * the same number re-landing, not a fresh guess.
     *
     * ⚠️ AND THE HISTORY IS WHY THIS FUNCTION LOOKS NEW BUT IS NOT. A song.getListData wrapper existed
     * before: added by d221f4c2 (canonical re-resolve for the playlist wrong-artist bug) and DELETED by
     * 04c67817 when the FALLBACK graft superseded it. Two project summaries describe it as shipped and
     * NEITHER records the deletion — which is why "match the shipped call shape" had nothing in the tree to
     * match when this was rebuilt. If a summary describes code you cannot find, check whether it was
     * removed rather than assuming it never landed.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE FOR THE GITHUB-VERIFICATION RULE IS THIS FUNCTION. Two people, a month
     * apart, with no access to each other's working notes, went to deezer-py's gw.py and came back with
     * the SAME two answers: SNG_IDS uppercase, and chunked at 100. The deleted d221f4c2 version carried
     * the comment "SNG_IDS is UPPERCASE (confirmed vs deezer-py)"; this one was derived the same way after
     * the summaries were found to contradict each other. Same source, same answer, twice — while four
     * traffic-capture attempts on the official app have produced nothing. Read the source.
