     * Tracks for a smarttracklist, via page.get on "smarttracklist/<id>" — the same gateway method Home
     * itself uses, with the id substituted into PAGE. That is the only endpoint reachable from what we
     * hold: the playlist methods take a playlist id, and this is not one.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE RESPONSE SHAPE IS INFERRED, NOT OBSERVED. Only the Home payload has been captured; the page
     * for an individual smarttracklist has not. The traversal below therefore assumes only the shape every
     * page.get response has shared so far — results.sections[].items[] — and finds tracks by asking each
     * item whether it parses as a song, rather than by indexing a section position or a module id.
     *
     * ON-DEVICE FAILURE MODE IF THAT ASSUMPTION IS WRONG, so the first build's symptom is legible:
     *  - Unexpected but well-formed JSON (sections elsewhere, or none) -> zero tracks -> throw below ->
     *    the track list shows an ERROR, not an endless spinner. IT DOES NOT STRAND, and that chain was
     *    read rather than assumed: Cached.loadPlaylistTracksCached materialises this PagedData.Single
     *    eagerly (feed.loadAll() inside coalescedTracks), so the throw lands in Cached.loadTracks's
     *    runCatching -> MediaDetailsViewModel.tracksLoadedFlow carries a failed Result -> the fragment's
     *    `loader` rethrows it into FeedData's `loadedState = runCatching { load(...) }`, which is the
     *    feed's error surface. Deliberately a throw and not an empty list — an empty list is
     *    indistinguishable from a mix Deezer legitimately emptied, and would look like a working feature
     *    quietly returning nothing.
     *  - An error body (bad/expired id) -> also zero tracks -> same error. The GladixDeezer line below
     *    names the id and the section count, which separates "we asked wrong" from "the page is empty".
     * Either way the failure is bounded to this one row: Home still renders, and nothing is cached (see
     * Cached.carriesExpiry — an item with an `expires` extra is never written to the durable store, so a
     * bad first load cannot stick for 24h).

    /**
     * ⚠⚠ DO NOT WRITE THE OBVIOUS GRAPHQL MAPPER HERE. IT WOULD LOOK FIXED AND BE UNPLAYABLE. ⚠⚠
     *
     * Deezer serves smarttracklist tracks over GRAPHQL (pipe.deezer.com, query GetSmartTracklist,
     * response at data.smartTracklist.tracks.edges[].node) — verified from
     * music-assistant/deezer-python-gql, queries/get_smart_tracklist.graphql. The tempting move once that
     * lands is to map those nodes straight to our Track. DO NOT.
     *
     * The node comes from the repo's TrackFields fragment: id, title, ISRC, diskInfo, duration,
     * isExplicit, isFavorite, popularity, album, contributors. THERE IS NO MD5_ORIGIN, NO FILESIZE_*, AND
     * NO TRACK_TOKEN — which are exactly the fields DeezerParser.toTrack builds `streamables` from. A
     * mapped Track therefore renders perfectly: right title, right artist, right cover, right duration —
     * and cannot play. THAT IS WORSE THAN TODAY'S FAILURE, which at least announces itself: a mix that
     * opens to a full track list and then fails at playback looks like a streaming bug, not a parsing
     * gap, and it costs a build plus a device test to discover. Today's version throws immediately.
     * A second mapper would also fork Deezer track parsing in two, so every future field change to
     * toTrack silently misses one path.
     *
     * THE SHAPE THAT WORKS: use GraphQL for the ID LIST ONLY (edges[].node.id), then fetch full gateway
     * records for those ids and hand them to the existing toTrack unchanged. Zero new parsing, real
     * streamables, one code path. That needs a chunked song.getListData wrapper in api/DeezerTrack.kt
     * (which has none today — `track(id)` posts a single SNG_ID, and N single calls for a 40-track mix is
     * not acceptable). MATCH THE SHIPPED CALL SHAPE FROM THE PIPER WORK: chunked, parameter SNG_IDS,
     * UPPERCASE, response read at results.data. gw-light params are effectively case-insensitive, so this
     * is consistency with a known-working call site rather than a requirement — take it anyway, it is free.
     *
     * GATED ON THE ID QUESTION, WHICH IS NOT YET ANSWERED. See the STL-ID probe in
     * DeezerHomeFeedClient.probeSmartTracklist: our Home item carries a SLOT id (SMARTTRACKLIST_ID,
     * "inspired-by-1", identical to CONFIGURATION_ID) and an INSTANCE id (data.ID, embedding a user id and
     * a date). Which one GraphQL accepts is unknown, the repo's fixtures are hand-written and prove
     * nothing, and open-source verification establishes that an endpoint EXISTS — not that it accepts the
     * ids we hold. playlist.getSongs was verified exactly this way, shipped, and did not answer the
     * question being asked of it. Do not build past the probe.
